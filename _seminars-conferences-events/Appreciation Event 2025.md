<h3><strong>Tax Academy Appreciation Event 2025</strong></h3>
<p>Tax Academy (TA) hosted an Appreciation Event on 2 December 2025 at Marriott
Tang Plaza Hotel. This year, we combined the Appreciation Event with our
Year-End Party for Alumni Network Members, bringing together approximately
200 guests for this special occasion.</p>
<p>The event celebrated the dedication and invaluable contributions of our
trainers, examiners and mentors, who have been instrumental in TA's growth
and success. As the network of networks, this gathering brought together
tax professionals to forge meaningful connections with trainers, examiners,
mentors and alumni. As we look ahead to our 20th anniversary next year,
we extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has been part of this
remarkable journey.</p>
