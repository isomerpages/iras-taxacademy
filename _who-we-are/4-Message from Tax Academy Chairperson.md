#Tax Academy Board

The Tax Academy is a premier tax centre and a strategic pillar of Singapore’s tax training infrastructure. Since its establishment in 2006,
the Tax Academy has played a major role in raising the industry’s tax competency and practice standards through the Academy’s comprehensive
suite of tax programmes. The tax environment is evolving rapidly to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive economic landscape 
and demands of governments and taxpayers. Tax professionals need to continuously upgrade and enhance their competencies to operate 
effectively in this global and complex environment. 

The Tax Academy of Singapore takes a leading role in developing and enhancing the international tax expertise of tax professionals. Apart 
from seminars and conferences on international tax, it will offer structured international tax programmes and create the pathway to 
post-graduate studies and research in international tax. TA’s efforts in jointly setting up with the Singapore Management University, the 
first tax research centre in Singapore, SMU-TA CET opens opportunities for the tax industry, academia and government to collaborate and 
develop thought leadership in tax. We will continue to provide high quality training in keeping with the learning needs of the tax 
community, and encourage robust knowledge exchange.
