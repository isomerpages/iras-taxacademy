### **Mrs Eng-Tay Geok Lee**<br>
**Chief Executive Officer**

Tax has grabbed the global headlines and agenda in the recent times. The global tax environment will become increasingly complex. It is imperative for tax professionals and tax practitioners to continue to grow and enhance their competency to meet these growing challenges. Business leaders, too, will find a need to apprise themselves of tax and the impact on their businesses.

> *Tax Academy offers a comprehensive tax education program on Singapore Tax, one that builds tax competency from foundational to the advanced level.*

Regular seminars and conferences on regional tax issues and global tax developments help participants stay current on international tax trends. Our partnership with world-renowned organizations and academia also enable the delivery of a complement of high-quality international tax training programmes that effectively enhance the knowledge and capabilities of the tax community. 

We, in Tax Academy, have taken on a leading role in tax training and education and will continue to champion the development of tax expertise through our wide suite of programmes. We aspire to build Singapore into a regional tax knowledge hub, one whereby tax professionals and tax officials from the region congregate for quality training and knowledge exchange.
