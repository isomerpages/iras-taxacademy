Governments around the world have been providing extensive fiscal support to help businesses and households cope with the pandemic. Looking ahead, tax measures will remain part of the support package offered by many jurisdictions even as more governments shift their attention and resources on post-pandemic recovery. Concurrently, the international tax rules are being reviewed in the ongoing discussions of the OECD Inclusive Framework. The evolving international tax developments would also have an impact on the future of global businesses and tax certainty would be a key concern for many businesses. Therefore, it is imperative for tax practitioners to keep abreast of these tax developments.

To equip the tax profession with the knowledge and skill sets to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex tax environment, the **Tax Academy offers a wide suite of quality structured tax training programmes, one that builds tax competency from foundational to the advanced level**. Through the organization of seminars and conferences on domestic, regional and global tax issues, the academy aims to provide a platform for tax practitioners to obtain updates on emerging tax developments and exchange views with the government, industry and academia.

In our global partnerships with renowned organisations and academia, we endeavour to uphold **our mission of raising the professional competency of the tax community and develop our standing as a leading centre for taxation and regional tax knowledge hub**. 

Being the **premier centre for tax education in Singapore**, the Tax Academy will continue to champion the development of tax expertise to support Singaporeâ€™s role as a global business hub.
