Join us in this event where our speakers, Mr Charles Li (Deputy Director, Law Division, IRAS) and Mr Yang Shi Yong (Director, Drew &amp; Napier LLC), provides an overview on the law of general partnerships, limited partnerships (“LPs”) and limited liability partnerships in Singapore.

* General tax issues: income tax, goods and services tax, and stamp duties
