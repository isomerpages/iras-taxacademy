##### **A Peek into the “Taxing Book” - The Law and Practice of Singapore Income Tax 3rd Edition Primers Series: Tax Planning and Avoidance**
**11 Dec**

ollowing the success of the first and second editions, the Tax Academy of Singapore is proud to announce the upcoming launch of the 3rd edition of The Law & Practice of Singapore Income Tax. An authoritative and comprehensive reference book on taxation of income, this edition aims to explain the fundamental changes to the tax landscape and updates on the Second Edition with a comprehensive coverage and analysis of case law developments, administrative guides and practical application of the income tax law, tax treaties and international tax agreements. In conjunction with the launch of the book, we are pleased to present a series of webinars where the authors will give an overview of what is covered in their respective chapters and expound on some of the topics. In addition, webinar participants will be entitled to a special 15% discount off the price of the book!

In this second webinar of the series, we are pleased to invite Ms Ong Ken Loon (Drew & Napier LLC, Head, Tax & Private Client Services) and Mr Charles Li (Drew & Napier LLC, Associate Director, Tax & Private Client Services), to share on the chapter on “Tax Planning and Avoidance”.  While both tax planning and tax avoidance are legal, employing inappropriate practices of tax avoidance in some cases may border on tax evasion.  On the other hand, tax planning is a process of elaborating the company’s financial related matters to maximise the tax benefits under eligible provisions of the tax framework. In this webinar, we will discuss the framework for tax planning and the application of the general anti-avoidance provision under section 33 of the Income Tax Act.

Agenda:

* This webinar will be conducted via Zoom
* An overview on the framework for tax planning
* Application of Section 33
* Interaction with tax offences
* Thoughts on recent developments in GAAR and Singapore’s effort to strengthen its anti-avoidance principles
* Discussion and Q&A session

##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series: Stopping the Carousel (Fraud)…**
**9 Dec**

The lnland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has made Missing Trader Fraud (MTF) also known as Carousel Fraud, a top priority of focus in its audit and investigation efforts. There are newspaper headlines of people under investigation for suspected involvement and the IRAS having new powers to arrest and seize goods. This was recently confirmed by the Second Finance Minister Mr Lawrence Wong in a Parliamentary response, that there are more than 300 GST-registered businesses under investigation as at end-2019, with a total tax amount of $450 million at stake.

It is not surprising that MTF arrangements are the subject of new legislative provisions introduced in the recent Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act 2020. The new provisions allow the IRAS to deny a taxable person’s input tax claims in circumstances where the business “knew or should have known” that its transactions were part of a fraudulent MTF arrangement. If the business “knew” that it was involved in a MTF arrangement, it could be found guilty of an offence. If the business “should have known” that it was involved in a MTF arrangement, a 10% surcharge to the input tax denied may be imposed on the business.

All GST-registered businesses will be affected to some extent. To help you understand the wide implications of the new GST provisions and the IRAS’ expectations of businesses under the new rules, please join us in our webinar where we have Mr Koh Soo How from Koh SH & Associates Pte Ltd, and Mr Yang Shi Yong and Mr Charles Li from Drew & Napier LLC, to explain the legal and practical aspects of the new rules and what it means to you.

Agenda:

* What is Missing Trader Fraud (MTF)
* The new Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act 2020
* Examples of MFT arrangements
* Circumstances that can give rise to a denial of input tax claims 
* What do you have to do to protect yourself
