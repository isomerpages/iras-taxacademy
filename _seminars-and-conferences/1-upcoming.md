##### **A Peek into the “Taxing Book” - The Law and Practice of Singapore Income Tax 3rd Edition Primers Series: Tax Residency, Withholding Tax and Taxation of Non-Residents**
**5 Feb CLOSED**

Following the success of the first and second editions, the Tax Academy of Singapore is proud to announce the launch of the 3rd edition of The Law & Practice of Singapore Income Tax. An authoritative and comprehensive reference book on taxation of income, this edition aims to explain the fundamental changes to the tax landscape and updates on the Second Edition with a comprehensive coverage and analysis of case law developments, administrative guides and practical application of the income tax law, tax treaties and international tax agreements.

In conjunction with the launch of the book, we are pleased to present a series of webinars where the authors will give an overview of what is covered in their respective chapters and expound on some of the topics.

In this third webinar of the series, we are pleased to invite Ms Toh Boon Ngee (Partner, Tax, Head of Transport, Shipping & Logistics Tax), from KPMG Advisory LLP, and Mr Chester Wee (Partner, Asean International Corporate Tax Advisory Leader, International Tax and Transaction Services), from Ernst & Young Solutions LLP, to share on the chapters on “Tax Residency” and “Withholding Tax and Taxation of Non-Residents”. 

Generally, the basis of taxation for a Singapore tax resident company does not differ materially from that for a non-tax resident company. However, there are differences in certain tax treatments, including withholding tax on certain payments made to non-resident companies. Withholding tax is a part of the overall tax collection mechanism, and businesses need to pay close attention to their withholding tax obligations as non-compliance can lead to hefty penalties from tax authorities.  In this webinar we will cover:

Agenda:
* Ascertaining corporate residence
* Implications of being a Singapore tax resident
* Singapore-sourced income provisions
* Withholding tax provision under Part XII of the Income Tax Act
* Practical examples and case studies
* Thoughts on company residency issues that may arise in the New Normal
* Discussion and Q&A session
