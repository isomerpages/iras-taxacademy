# **Tax Academy Signature Conference 2021: Taxes and Investments in a Post-Pandemic World**

Tax Academy held a successful virtual conference on [Taxes and Investments in a Post Pandemic World](https://www.taxacademy.sg/seminars-and-conferences/upcoming/#3Sep-ta-id) on 3 September. 

More than 350 participants took away a key message that Singapore will adjust its corporate tax system as needed, if and when a consensus is fully reached. We will abide by the internationally agreed standards, safeguard our taxing rights and seek to minimize the compliance burden for businesses. 

**Opening Address**

In her opening address at the event, Minister Indranee Rajah shared about the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS 2.0) Project, which involves a revision of international tax rules.

**Opening Address** by Guest-of-Honour, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister for Finance and National Development, Ms Indranee Rajah.

“There is strong international momentum to achieve a global agreement on BEPS, including a minimum effective tax rate of at least 15%, by the end of this year. Post-BEPS 2.0, Singapore as a small economy will have to work harder than ever to attract and retain investment. But we are no strangers to hard work and meeting challenges. Together, we can strengthen or build new advantages, and seek new opportunities.”  - Minister Indranee Rajah
