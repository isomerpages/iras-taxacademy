<p>Great to host representatives from the&nbsp;Competition and Consumer Commission
of Singapore (CCCS)&nbsp;and&nbsp;MTI Academy&nbsp;for a productive knowledge-sharing
session!
<br>
<br>Drawing on Tax Academy's 19-year journey as Singapore's leading center
for tax knowledge, we shared our experiences in building a robust professional
academy. The discussions were incredibly insightful, revealing valuable
synergies with both CCCS's vision for consumer protection and competition,
and MTI Academy's work in developing trade-related training.
<br>
<br>The CCCS team, who overseas competition and consumer protection laws in
Singapore, found valuable parallels between their vision and Tax Academy’s
framework. Similarly, MTI Academy which complements the Trade and Industry
Divisions’ work by developing relevant trade related training modules for
government and public officers, gained insights into our experience in
building customised professional programmes.
<br>
<br>This session was a powerful reminder of our unique approach at Tax Academy:
<br>😃 We work towards common shared goals -&nbsp;focus on doing in a collaborative
approach, creating significant impact and influence.
<br>😃 We are a network of networks -&nbsp;connecting and empowering professionals
across the tax ecosystem.
<br>😃 We, uniquely bring together government, industry, and academia
<br>
<br>This session underscored a shared commitment to enhancing professional
education and building capability across our respective domains. Looking
forward to exploring these synergies with CCCS and MTI Academy!</p>
