<p>Great to host representatives from the&nbsp;Competition and Consumer Commission
of Singapore (CCCS)&nbsp;and&nbsp;MTI Academy&nbsp;for a productive knowledge-sharing
session!
<br>
<br>Drawing on Tax Academy's 19-year journey as Singapore's leading center
for tax knowledge, we shared our experiences in building a robust professional
academy. The discussions were incredibly insightful, revealing valuable
synergies with both CCCS's vision for consumer protection and competition,
and MTI Academy's work in developing trade-related training.
<br>
<br>The CCCS team, who overseas competition and consumer protection laws in
Singapore, found valuable parallels between their vision and Tax Academy’s
framework. Similarly, MTI Academy which complements the Trade and Industry
Divisions’ work by developing relevant trade related training modules for
government and public officers, gained insights into our experience in
building customised professional programmes.
<br>
<br>This session was a powerful reminder of our unique approach at Tax Academy:
<br>😃 We work towards common shared goals -&nbsp;focus on doing in a collaborative
approach, creating significant impact and influence.
<br>😃 We are a network of networks -&nbsp;connecting and empowering professionals
across the tax ecosystem.
<br>😃 We, uniquely bring together government, industry, and academia
<br>
<br>This session underscored a shared commitment to enhancing professional
education and building capability across our respective domains. Looking
forward to exploring these synergies with CCCS and MTI Academy!</p>

<br>
<br>We are delighted to share that our Singapore teams have achieved remarkable
success at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tax-executives-institute/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Tax Executives Institute</a> International
Tax Student Case Competition, held from 14 to 16 August 2025 in Montreal,
Canada. Tax Academy proudly supported two teams from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ntusg/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Nanyang Technological University Singapore</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-university-of-singapore/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">National University of Singapore</a>in this prestigious competition.
<br>
<br>The NTU team demonstrated exceptional skill in solving complex international
tax cases, securing first place against strong competition from universities
worldwide, including experienced postgraduate students with years of tax
practice. Their victory is a testament to Singapore's excellence in tax
education. The NUS team also displayed outstanding talent and represented
Singapore with distinction. Both teams, guided by dedicated mentors (
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-ying-jow-36604a5/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lee Ying Jow</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-poh-69b9a415/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Simon Poh</a>,

<br>
<br>This marks the third year of the TEI International Tax Student Case Competition,
which offers students invaluable exposure to real-world tax scenarios while
fostering connections with international practitioners and peers.
<br>
<br>This achievement is particularly meaningful as we recently signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) with TEI, focusing on knowledge exchange through
various initiatives including seminars, networking events, and student
development programmes.
<br>
<br>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josie-scalia-cpa/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Josephine (Josie) Scalia</a> from

<p>Balancing Digital Taxes and Geopolitics: The European Dilemma]
<br>
<br>Dr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leopoldo-parada-86818824/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Leopoldo Parada</a> led
a thought provoking webinar earlier this week on&nbsp;"Balancing Digital
Taxes and Geopolitics: The European Dilemma."&nbsp;It was great to see
a fantastic mix of participants from both the industry and government tuning
in from across the region.
<br>
<br>The session offered key insights into the strategic and policy options
available to the European Union for taxing the digital economy. We received
a detailed analysis on whether a new, EU-wide Digital Services Tax (DST)
is a viable path forward, or if adapting the existing VAT system presents
a more politically feasible and effective alternative.
<br>
<br>What our participants say:
<br>😀 “A great starting point for beginners new to the subject to gain a
good overview.”
<br>😀 “Dr. Leopoldo offered interesting viewpoint, providing a valuable regional
perspective in response to participant's question.”
<br>
<br>A big thank you to Dr. Parada for his fantastic presentation, and to all
the participants for their active engagement and insightful questions.&nbsp;The
event was a true example of how industry, government, and academia can
connect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Global Tax Reform and Trade Tariffs - China's Perspective]

<br>We had a great afternoon with Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yansheng-zhu-53245b49/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Yansheng Zhu</a>,
who offered fascinating insights into China's perspective on global tax
reform.
<br>
<br>The session provided a deep look into China's strategic and evolving role
in global tax governance. Professor Zhu highlighted how recent tax reforms
and responses to global trade tensions are impacting multinational enterprises
(MNEs) and cross-border investments, giving participants a comprehensive
view of China's position on these critical issues.
<br>
<br>What our participants say:
<br>😀 “Professor Zhu gave a very comprehensive overview and background of
China's policies and approach towards international tax governance. I also
appreciated his thought-provoking questions especially around the US' imposition
of tariffs.”
<br>
<br>😀 “The speaker's in-depth knowledge provided invaluable clarity on China's
approach to international tax policies, and its position on BEPS Pillars
1 and 2."
<br>
<br>A huge thank you to Professor Zhu for his deep technical expertise and
valuable insights, and to all the participants for their enthusiasm and
thoughtful questions.</p>

<p>新加坡欢迎您, Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yansheng-zhu-53245b49/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Yansheng Zhu</a>!
<br>
<br>The first academic presentation at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stari-sg/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">STARI-SG</a> Launch
Conference featured Professor Zhu Yansheng, who delivered an insightful
lecture on "The Development of the Theoretical Framework for Allocating
Taxing Rights on Income from Cross-Border Transactions."
<br>
<br>Professor Zhu brings distinguished expertise as a professor at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/xiamen-university-cn/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Xiamen University</a> (XMU)
Law School and serves as the associate director of XMU's Centre for International
Tax Law and Comparative Taxation. His academic prowess spans tax law and
commercial law, with specialisation in international tax law, international
investment law, Chinese company law, and trust law.
<br>
<br>During his presentation, he provided a comprehensive analysis of how taxing
rights are allocated for cross-border transactions, examining the evolving
framework established by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework. His discussion
shed light on the complexities and implications of these international
tax arrangements.
<br>
<br>Professor Zhu's insights have already enriched our understanding of cross-border
taxation, and there's more to come! Let's continue this journey of knowledge
exchange! ✨</p>
<p></p>
<p>From London to the Lion City - the second academic presentation featured
Dr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leopoldo-parada-86818824/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Leopoldo Parada</a> from

halls of King's College London in June 2025. Today, he delivered compelling
insights on "Levelling the Playing Field: Competitiveness Beyond Pillar
Two."
<br>
<br>Dr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leopoldo-parada-86818824/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Leopoldo Parada</a> serves

King's College London.
<br>
<br>His session delivered compelling insights, particularly his personal observation
that the phrase "levelling the playing field" serves more as a political
rallying rather than a genuine commitment to equalising opportunities between
developed and developing countries. He emphasised that meaningful reform
requires more than technical adjustments—it demands a fundamental shift
towards truly inclusive and participatory rulemaking, where all countries
have a substantive voice in shaping the international tax landscape of
the future.

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stari-sg/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">STARI-SG</a> was honoured
to welcome Professor Michael Dirkis from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-sydney/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">University of Sydney</a> for
the inaugural STARI visiting professorship lecture. His thought-provoking
presentation on "Living in Uncertain Times: The Future of International
Tax Cooperation" set a high standard for the series.
<br>
<br>Professor Dirkis brings over 30 years of taxation law expertise through
his distinguished career spanning the Australian Taxation Office, academia,
and the private sector. As a prominent researcher, he has authored and
co-authored more than 600 publications and papers.
<br>
<br>During his insightful lecture, he offered valuable insights into the Future
of International Tax Cooperation amidst today's uncertain landscape. A
key point of discussion was the misalignment between Global Intangible
Low-Tax Income (GILTI) and Pillar Two, specifically how GILTI employs a
global averaging approach rather than the jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction
minimum tax method advocated by Pillar Two. Of particular interest was
his analysis of the US position, where he noted that any targeted taxation
of US subsidiaries would likely trigger reciprocal measures, potentially
subjecting subsidiaries from other jurisdictions to elevated US tax rates.
<br>
<br>We are deeply honoured to host Professor Dirkis in Singapore and look
forward to fostering meaningful collaborations that will enrich the international
tax research landscape.</p>

<p>The integration of AI in the tax administration is not simply a technological
shift; it is a legal and institutional transformation.”
<br>
<br>This insight comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacey-fernandez-678016156/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Stacey Fernandez</a>,
a financial prosecutor with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/agcsingapore/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Attorney-General's Chambers, Singapore</a>,
who presented her research at a conference in Rust in July this year.
<br>
<br>The team led by Associate Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-phua-6a806038/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Stephen Phua</a>,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-sim-20aa171/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sam Sim</a>and Stacey Fernandez, authored a research paper titled "The
Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Tax Law". As Singapore's representatives
at the conference, Stephen and Stacey served as national reporters, sharing
their findings on AI's transformative role in tax administration. The conference
provided an invaluable platform to engage with international participants
and practitioners, exchanging diverse perspectives on AI implementation
in tax systems.
<br>
<br>Their report explored three critical themes:
<br>Definitions and Governance of AI
<br>Tax Incentives
<br>The Legal Limits on AI Use by Tax Administrations
<br>
<br>As AI continues to reshape tax systems globally, how is your organisation
preparing for this transformation?

<br>
<br>We had the pleasure of hosting a roundtable discussion with 7 distinguished

<p>[A Career in Tax – Multifaceted Options and Opportunities]
<br>
<br>Myth Busted: Tax is Fun!
<br>
<br>Last Friday, we wrapped up a really lively fireside chat that gave attendees
an inside look at tax careers!
<br>
<br>If anyone ever told you tax is a dull career, they clearly haven't met
our phenomenal panel moderated by Mr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennislui/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dennis Lui</a> (CEO
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tax-academy-of-singapore/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Tax Academy of Singapore</a>and Deputy Commissioner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/iras/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)</a>),
comprising of Mr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-baik-77084736/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Andy Baik</a> (Tax
Partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kpmg-singapore/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">KPMG Singapore</a>),
Ms&nbsp;Belinda Chan&nbsp;(Head of Tax,&nbsp;Temasek), Ms <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-loon-ong/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ken Loon Ong</a> (Head
of Tax and Private Clients, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/drew-&amp;-napier-llc/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Drew &amp; Napier LLC</a>).
<br>
<br>We heard candid stories about their diverse paths 🛣️ to success and what
keeps their passion for tax burning bright🔥. A key takeaway? While technology
like AI is transforming our profession, the&nbsp;strategic thinking, global
perspective, and human touch of tax professionals are more indispensable
than ever.
<br>
<br>The panel debunked common myths:
<br>
<br>🌟Myth 1: Tax is narrow?
<br>Absolutely not! It's a&nbsp;dynamic field&nbsp;that demands a broad skill
set, from law and accounting to strategy and technology. The tax landscape&nbsp;cuts
across all industries, giving you incredibly diverse experiences. For tax
lawyers, the work is far from one-dimensional, encompassing both&nbsp;litigation
and corporate advisory. Tax uniquely blends&nbsp;analytical rigor with
innovative problem-solving, it also teaches you a deep appreciation for
the law, a&nbsp;valuable and transferable skill&nbsp;that extends far beyond
tax work itself.
<br>
<br>🌟Myth 2: Tax careers are local?
<br>With global tax changes and interconnected economies, a tax career offers&nbsp;boundless
international opportunities. You'll also gain a&nbsp;crucial platform in
tax policy and advocacy, essential for safeguarding the&nbsp;Singapore
Tax Regime&nbsp;on the global stage. Plus,&nbsp;networking and collaboration
across jurisdictions&nbsp;are key, making this a truly expansive and impactful
path.
<br>
<br>🌟 Myth 3: AI will replace tax practitioners?
<br>While&nbsp;AI is excellent for enhancing efficiency&nbsp;in many tax-related
tasks, tax professionals are still crucially needed for&nbsp;tax policy
development, complex negotiations and ensuring tax certainty. These are
areas where nuanced understanding, strategic thinking, and interpersonal
skills are irreplaceable.
<br>
<br>This session was a powerful affirmation for aspiring and current tax professionals
on the vibrant future of a career in tax. Our sincere thanks to the panelists
for their valuable insights, and to all participants who made this such
an engaging discussion!

<p>Time weaves its own story – it seems like just yesterday when we were
in London with Ms <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/azlina-bulmer-67596217/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Azlina Bulmer</a>,
ICAEW Interim International Director, witnessing the historic signing of
our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/icaew/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">ICAEW</a> this
June 2025.
<br>
<br>Today brought another delightful chapter as we reconnected over lunch
with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/azlina-bulmer-67596217/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Azlina Bulmer</a> in
Singapore along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-hong-a20a8319/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Elaine Hong</a>,

Head of Singapore ICAEW. Our engaging discussions led us to the topic of
AI. While we celebrated the transformative power of AI in our industry,
we all shared a profound appreciation for what technology cannot replicate
– the genuine connections, warm handshakes, and meaningful relationships
that form the cornerstone of lasting partnerships.
<br>
<br>Our discussions have paved the way for meaningful initiatives that will
benefit both organisations. Let's stay in touch as we continue to develop
these exciting plans together.</p>
<p></p>

<p>"Tax is fun" - a phrase we live by at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tax-academy-of-singapore/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Tax Academy of Singapore</a>.
But what makes it truly engaging?
<br>
<br>For us, it's about the connections we forge globally. Just recently, our
conversations with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhslee/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Andrew Lee</a> and
Affiliate Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-vanhee-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%D9%8A-7619563/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Thomas Vanhee توماس فانهي</a> highlighted
this perfectly. These aren't just formal exchanges - they're opportunities
to share insights and build lasting professional relationships.
<br>
<br>Our recent discussion with Professor Vanhee revealed how closely our views
on tax education align. We share the vision that tax knowledge should be
practical, forward-looking, and globally relevant. His insights on regional
developments complemented our approach at Tax Academy - where we believe
in preparing tax professionals not just for today's challenges, but for
tomorrow's innovations.
<br>
<br>Together, we're building a future where tax education transcends borders,
creating professionals ready for the evolving global tax landscape.</p>
