<p>Great to host representatives from the&nbsp;Competition and Consumer Commission
of Singapore (CCCS)&nbsp;and&nbsp;MTI Academy&nbsp;for a productive knowledge-sharing
session!
<br>
<br>Drawing on Tax Academy's 19-year journey as Singapore's leading center
for tax knowledge, we shared our experiences in building a robust professional
academy. The discussions were incredibly insightful, revealing valuable
synergies with both CCCS's vision for consumer protection and competition,
and MTI Academy's work in developing trade-related training.
<br>
<br>The CCCS team, who overseas competition and consumer protection laws in
Singapore, found valuable parallels between their vision and Tax Academy’s
framework. Similarly, MTI Academy which complements the Trade and Industry
Divisions’ work by developing relevant trade related training modules for
government and public officers, gained insights into our experience in
building customised professional programmes.
<br>
<br>This session was a powerful reminder of our unique approach at Tax Academy:
<br>😃 We work towards common shared goals -&nbsp;focus on doing in a collaborative
approach, creating significant impact and influence.
<br>😃 We are a network of networks -&nbsp;connecting and empowering professionals
across the tax ecosystem.
<br>😃 We, uniquely bring together government, industry, and academia
<br>
<br>This session underscored a shared commitment to enhancing professional
education and building capability across our respective domains. Looking
forward to exploring these synergies with CCCS and MTI Academy!</p>

<br>
<br>We are delighted to share that our Singapore teams have achieved remarkable
success at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tax-executives-institute/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Tax Executives Institute</a> International
Tax Student Case Competition, held from 14 to 16 August 2025 in Montreal,
Canada. Tax Academy proudly supported two teams from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ntusg/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Nanyang Technological University Singapore</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-university-of-singapore/" class="rvxSAhdspoaQIXROVGmqmgSjAEonUrxjJfTUU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">National University of Singapore</a>in this prestigious competition.
<br>
<br>The NTU team demonstrated exceptional skill in solving complex international
tax cases, securing first place against strong competition from universities
worldwide, including experienced postgraduate students with years of tax
practice. Their victory is a testament to Singapore's excellence in tax
education. The NUS team also displayed outstanding talent and represented
Singapore with distinction. Both teams, guided by dedicated mentors (

underwent months of rigorous preparation for this challenge.
<br>
<br>This marks the third year of the TEI International Tax Student Case Competition,
which offers students invaluable exposure to real-world tax scenarios while
fostering connections with international practitioners and peers.
<br>
<br>This achievement is particularly meaningful as we recently signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) with TEI, focusing on knowledge exchange through
various initiatives including seminars, networking events, and student
development programmes.
<br>
<br>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josie-scalia-cpa/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Josephine (Josie) Scalia</a> from
