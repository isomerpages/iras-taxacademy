<h2><strong>Post Conference Highlights on International Tax Disputes Day: The Asian and Global Landscape, 22 May 2025</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>"Singapore, if you think about the topic of tax certainty, is one of the capitals, the lighthouse of international tax certainty, one of the capitals where tax certainty isn't just talked about but it's lived. It lives in our Inland Revenue approaches, so there's a lot that the world can learn…”</em>
</p>
<p><em>“(Tax Academy of Singapore) is a great institution to have, it’s a great idea to bring practitioners together, to bring people from tax administrations, from universities together…”</em>
</p>

<p>Singapore stands as a beacon of tax certainty, where theory meets practice
through IRAS' innovative approaches. At the International Tax Disputes
Day conference on 22 May 2025, Tax Academy brought together over 200 distinguished
professionals - including 70 senior partners and C-suite executives - to
explore how tax certainty drives sustainable economic development. This
high-level gathering exemplified our commitment to bridging expertise across
tax administration, practice, and academia.</p>
<p>In his opening address, IRAS Commissioner and CEO Mr Ow Fook Chuen highlighted
Singapore's practical commitment to tax certainty. From our extensive treaty
network to proactive dispute prevention measures, Singapore is building
a tax ecosystem that gives businesses confidence to operate in an increasingly
complex global environment.</p>
<p>Dr Achim Pross's keynote highlighted APAC's distinctive approach to tax
disputes: despite its significant economic weight - one-third of Inclusive
Framework GDP - the region shows remarkably few MAP cases, demonstrating
its success in dispute prevention over resolution.</p>
<p>The conference featured dynamic discussions from 19 distinguished speakers
- a diverse mix of academics, practitioners, and policy makers from Singapore
and overseas. Beyond intellectual discourse, the event provided an invaluable
platform for networking, fostering connections between local and international
tax professionals including students of Tax Academy NextGen awardees.</p>
<p>Tax Academy would like to thank all speakers, panellists, guests and participants
for making this conference a success!</p>
