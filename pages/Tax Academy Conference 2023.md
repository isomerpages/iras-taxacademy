##### **Friday, 29 September 2023 | 9.00am to 4.30pm<br><br>Fee: SGD 324 (inclusive of GST)<br>Venue: Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel**

Tax Academy is pleased to present its biennial tax conference 2023 “Navigating BEPS 2.0 – Opportunities and Challenges”. 

In October 2021, the Inclusive Framework (IF) on BEPS agreed to a Two-Pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. The Two-Pillar solution, also known as BEPS 2.0, was accepted by more than 135 member jurisdictions of the IF, including Singapore. This agreement is considered as one of the most significant reforms on the international tax front.  Several jurisdictions are currently working on incorporating the Pillar 2 GloBE tax rules into their domestic laws.

The conference will offer insights into the new international tax landscape where policy makers, tax professionals and academia will come together to discuss the global tax developments and how these developments will affect businesses and the tax administrations.
